# Post App – Fullstack Application

A fullstack application focused on a robust and scalable backend architecture using Node.js, with performance optimizations through Redis caching.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize ORM
- Redis (caching)
- JWT Authentication

**Frontend**
- AngularJS
- HTML5
- CSS3

## ✨ Key Features
- User authentication and authorization using JWT
- CRUD operations for posts with access control
